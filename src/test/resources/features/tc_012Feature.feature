Feature: Regression and Integration Tests on Claim Accounting Report

  Scenario: Validate integration after enhancements on Claim Accounting Report
    Given I access the Claim Accounting Report module
    When I execute the integration tests on the module
    Then the new design and formulas should not affect other reports

  Scenario: Validate interface and data consistency
    Given I have mockups and real data inputs
    When I perform the interface and data consistency tests
    Then the report should remain coherent and free from integration errors
